\opening{Dear Editor,}

Thank you for the opportunity to revise the manuscript `Power and sample size calculations for fMRI studies based on the prevalence of active peaks.' by Durnez, Degryse, Moerkerke, Poline, Seurinck, Sochat, Poldrack and Nichols.  We hereby submit the revised version for publication in NeuroImage.

We have included a point-by-point list of answers to the referees' comments.

Thanking you for your help, we remain,


\closing{Sincerely,}
%I made a pdf file of my signature using the scanner, so that all the cover letters I sent
%electronically were "signed."

Joke Durnez
