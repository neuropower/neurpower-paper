abstract = {Modern scientific technology has provided a new class of large-scale simultaneous inference problems, with thousands of hypothe-sis tests to consider at the same time. Microarrays epitomize this type of technology, but similar situations arise in proteomics, spec-troscopy, imaging, and social science surveys. This paper uses false discovery rate methods to carry out both size and power calculations on large-scale problems. A simple empirical Bayes approach allows the false discovery rate (fdr) analysis to proceed with a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Closed-form accuracy formulas are derived for estimated false discovery rates, and used to compare different methodologies: local or tail-area fdr's, theoretical, permutation, or empirical null hypothesis estimates. Two microarray data sets as well as simulations are used to evaluate the methodology, the power diagnostics showing why nonnull cases might easily fail to appear on a list of " significant " discoveries.},

@article{Skol2006,
abstract = {Genome-wide association is a promising approach to identify common genetic variants that predispose to human disease. Because of the high cost of genotyping hundreds of thousands of markers on thousands of subjects, genome-wide association studies often follow a staged design in which a proportion (pi(samples)) of the available samples are genotyped on a large number of markers in stage 1, and a proportion (pi(samples)) of these markers are later followed up by genotyping them on the remaining samples in stage 2. The standard strategy for analyzing such two-stage data is to view stage 2 as a replication study and focus on findings that reach statistical significance when stage 2 data are considered alone. We demonstrate that the alternative strategy of jointly analyzing the data from both stages almost always results in increased power to detect genetic association, despite the need to use more stringent significance levels, even when effect sizes differ between the two stages. We recommend joint analysis for all two-stage genome-wide association studies, especially when a relatively large proportion of the samples are genotyped in stage 1 (pi(samples) {\textgreater}or= 0.30), and a relatively large proportion of markers are selected for follow-up in stage 2 (pi(markers) {\textgreater}or= 0.01).},

abstract = {The assessment of significant activations in functional imaging using voxel-based methods often relies on results derived from the theory of Gaussian random fields. These results solve the multiple comparison problem and assume that the spatial correlation or smoothness of the data is known or can be estimated. End results (i. e., P values associated with local maxima, clusters, or sets of clusters) critically depend on this assessment, which should be as exact and as reliable as possible. In some earlier implementations of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (SPM94, SPM95) the smoothness was assessed on Gaussianized t-fields (Gt-f) that are not generally free of physiological signal. This technique has two limitations. First, the estimation is not stable (the variance of the estimator being far from negligible) and, second, physiological signal in the Gt-f will bias the estimation. In this paper, we describe an estimation method that overcomes these drawbacks. The new approach involves estimating the smoothness of standardized residual fields which approximates the smoothness of the component fields of the associated t-field. Knowing the smoothness of these component fields is important because it allows one to compute corrected P values for statistical fields other than the t-field or the Gt-f (e.g., the F-map) and eschews bias due to deviation from the null hypothesis. We validate the method on simulated data and demonstrate it using data from a functional MRI study.},

Using 1326 subjects from the IMAGEN study, we first give a global picture of the evolution of the group effect t-value from a simple face-watching contrast with increasing cohort size. We obtain a wide activated pattern, far from being limited to the reasonably expected brain areas, illustrating the difference between statistical significance and practical significance. This motivates us to inject tissue-probability information into the group estimation, we model the BOLD contrast using a matter-weighted mixture of Gaussians and compare it to the common, single-Gaussian model. In both cases, the model parameters are estimated per-voxel for one subgroup, and the likelihood of both models is computed on a second, separate subgroup to reflect model generalization capacity. Various group sizes are tested, and significance is asserted using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. We conclude that adding matter information consistently improves the quantitative analysis of BOLD responses in some areas of the brain, particularly those where accurate inter-subject registration remains challenging.},

abstract = {The large-scale sharing of task-based functional neuroimaging data has the potential to allow novel insights into the organization of mental function in the brain, but the field of neuroimaging has lagged behind other areas of bioscience in the development of data sharing resources. This paper describes the OpenFMRI project (accessible online at http://www.openfmri.org), which aims to provide the neuroimaging community with a resource to support open sharing of task-based fMRI studies. We describe the motivation behind the project, focusing particularly on how this project addresses some of the well-known challenges to sharing of task-based fMRI data. Results from a preliminary analysis of the current database are presented, which demonstrate the ability to classify between task contrasts with high generalization accuracy across subjects, and the ability to identify individual subjects from their activation maps with moderately high accuracy. Clustering analyses show that the similarity relations between statistical maps have a somewhat orderly relation to the mental functions engaged by the relevant tasks. These results highlight the potential of the project to support large-scale multivariate analyses of the relation between mental processes and brain function.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is an increasingly popular and valuable tool for summarizing results across many neuroimaging studies. It can be used to establish consensus on the locations of functional regions, test hypotheses developed from patient and animal studies and develop new hypotheses on structure-function correspondence. It is particularly valuable in neuroimaging because most studies do not adequately correct for multiple comparisons; based on statistical thresholds used, we estimate that roughly 10-20{\%} of reported activations in published studies are false positives. In this article, we briefly summarize some of the most popular meta-analytic approaches and their limitations, and we outline a revised multilevel approach with increased validity for establishing consistency across studies. We also discuss multivariate methods by which meta-analysis can be used to develop and test hypotheses about co-activity of brain regions. Finally, we argue that meta-analyses can make a uniquely valuable contribution to predicting psychological states from patterns of brain activity, and we briefly discuss some methods for making such predictions.},

abstract = {Age is one of the most salient aspects in faces and of fundamental cognitive and social relevance. Although face processing has been studied extensively, brain regions responsive to age have yet to be localized. Using evocative face morphs and fMRI, we segregate two areas extending beyond the previously established face-sensitive core network, centered on the inferior temporal sulci and angular gyri bilaterally, both of which process changes of facial age. By means of probabilistic tractography, we compare their patterns of functional activation and structural connectivity. The ventral portion of Wernicke's understudied perpendicular association fasciculus is shown to interconnect the two areas, and activation within these clusters is related to the probability of fiber connectivity between them. In addition, post-hoc age-rating competence is found to be associated with high response magnitudes in the left angular gyrus. Our results provide the first evidence that facial age has a distinct representation pattern in the posterior human brain. We propose that particular face-sensitive nodes interact with additional object-unselective quantification modules to obtain individual estimates of facial age. This brain network processing the age of faces differs from the cortical areas that have previously been linked to less developmental but instantly changeable face aspects. Our probabilistic method of associating activations with connectivity patterns reveals an exemplary link that can be used to further study, assess and quantify structure-function relationships.},

@article{Woo2014,
abstract = {Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p{\textless}.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our laboratory (N=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p{\textless}.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.},

abstract = {This article considers the efficiency of event-related fMRI designs in terms of the optimum temporal pattern of stimulus or trial presentations. The distinction between "stochastic" and "deterministic" is used to distinguish between designs that are specified in terms of the probability that an event will occur at a series of time points (stochastic) and those in which events always occur at prespecified time (deterministic). Stochastic designs may be "stationary," in which the probability is constant, or nonstationary, in which the probabilities change with time. All these designs can be parameterized in terms of a vector of occurrence probabilities and a prototypic design matrix that embodies constraints (such as the minimum stimulus onset asynchrony) and the model of hemodynamic responses. A simple function of these parameters is presented and used to compare the relative efficiency of different designs. Designs with slow modulation of occurrence probabilities are generally more efficient than stationary designs. Interestingly the most efficient design is a conventional block design. A critical point, made in this article, is that the most efficient design for one effect may not be the most efficient for another. This is particularly important when considering evoked responses and the differences among responses. The most efficient designs for evoked responses, as opposed to differential responses, require trial-free periods during which baseline levels can be attained. In the context of stochastic, rapid-presentation designs this is equivalent to the inclusion of "null events."},

With appropriately designed tasks, the results of fMRI studies can guide resection, thereby preserving vital brain tissue. The mass univariate approach to fMRI data analysis consists of performing a statistical test in each voxel, which is used to classify voxels as either active or inactive-that is, related, or not, to the task of interest. In cognitive neuroscience, the focus is on controlling the rate of false positives while accounting for the severe multiple testing problem of searching the brain for activations. However, stringent control of false positives is accompanied by a risk of false negatives, which can be detrimental, particularly in clinical settings where false negatives may lead to surgical resection of vital brain tissue. Consequently, for clinical applications, we argue for a testing procedure with a stronger focus on preventing false negatives. We present a thresholding procedure that incorporates information on false positives and false negatives. We combine two measures of significance for each voxel: a classical p-value, which reflects evidence against the null hypothesis of no activation, and an alternative p-value, which reflects evidence against activation of a prespecified size. This results in a layered statistical map for the brain. One layer marks voxels exhibiting strong evidence against the traditional null hypothesis, while a second layer marks voxels where activation cannot be confidently excluded.

@article{Friston1996,
abstract = {This paper is about detecting activations in statistical parametric maps and considers the relative sensitivity of a nested hierarchy of tests that we have framed in terms of the level of inference (voxel level, cluster level, and set level). These tests are based on the probability of obtaining c, or more, clusters with k, or more, voxels, above a threshold u. This probability has a reasonably simple form and is derived using distributional approximations from the theory of Gaussian fields. The most important contribution of this work is the notion of set-level inference. Set-level inference refers to the statistical inference that the number of clusters comprising an observed activation profile is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This inference pertains to the set of activations reaching criteria and represents a new way of assigning P values to distributed effects. Cluster-level inferences are a special case of set-level inferences, which obtain when the number of clusters c = 1. Similarly voxel-level inferences are special cases of cluster-level inferences that result when the cluster can be very small (i.e., k = 0). Using a theoretical power analysis of distributed activations, we observed that set-level inferences are generally more powerful than cluster-level inferences and that cluster-level inferences are generally more powerful than voxel-level inferences. The price paid for this increased sensitivity is reduced localizing power: Voxel-level tests permit individual voxels to be identified as significant, whereas cluster-and set-level inferences only allow clusters or sets of clusters to be so identified. For all levels of inference the spatial size of the underlying signal f (relative to resolution) determines the most powerful thresholds to adopt. For set-level inferences if f is large (e.g., fMRI) then the optimum extent threshold should be greater than the expected number of voxels for each cluster. If f is small (e.g., PET) the extent threshold should be small. We envisage that set-level inferences will find a role in making statistical inferences about distributed activations, particularly in fMRI.},

Although the necessity of hV5/MT+ for motion perception has been revealed by means of TMS, its relevance for motion imagery remains unclear. We induced a direction-selective adaptation in hV5/MT+ by means of an MAE while subjects performed a mental rotation task that elicits imagined motion. We concurrently measured behavioral performance and neural activity with fMRI, enabling us to directly assess the effect of a perturbation of hV5/MT+ on other cortical areas involved in the mental rotation task. The activity in hV5/MT+ increased as more mental rotation was required, and the perturbation of hV5/MT+ affected behavioral performance as well as the neural activity in this area. Moreover, several regions in the posterior parietal cortex were also affected by this perturbation. Our results show that hV5/MT+ is required for imagined visual motion and engages in an interaction with parietal cortex during this cognitive process.},

In this paper, we show how estimating the number of activated peaks or clusters enables one to estimate post-hoc how powerful the selection procedure performs. This procedure can be used in real studies as a diagnostics tool, and raises awareness on how much activation is potentially missed.

abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a widespread technique in cognitive psychology that allows visualizing brain activation. The data analysis encompasses an enormous number of simultaneous statistical tests. Procedures that either control the familywise error rate or the false discovery rate have been applied to these data. These methods are mostly validated in terms of average sensitivity and specificity. However, procedures are not comparable if requirements on their error rates differ. Moreover, less attention has been given to the instability or variability of results. In a simulation study in the context of imaging, we first compare the Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg procedures. Considering Bonferroni as a way to control the expected number of type I errors enables more lenient thresholding compared to familywise error rate control and a direct comparison between both procedures. We point out that while the same balance is obtained between average sensitivity and specificity, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure appears less stable. Secondly, we have implemented the procedure of Gordon et al. () (originally proposed for gene selection) that includes stability, measured through bootstrapping, in the decision criterion. Simulations indicate that the method attains the same balance between sensitivity and specificity. It improves the stability of Benjamini-Hochberg but does not outperform Bonferroni, making this computationally heavy bootstrap procedure less appealing. Third, we show how stability of thresholding procedures can be assessed using real data. In a dataset on face recognition, we again find that Bonferroni renders more stable results.},

abstract = {The analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data involves multiple stages of data pre-processing before the activation can be statistically detected. Spatial smoothing is a very common pre-processing step in the analysis of functional brain imaging data. This study presents a broad perspective on the influence of spatial smoothing on fMRI group activation results. The data obtained from 20 volunteers during a visual oddball task were used for this study. Spatial smoothing using an isotropic gaussian filter kernel with full width at half maximum (FWHM) sizes 2 to 30 mm with a step of 2 mm was applied in two levels - smoothing of fMRI data and/or smoothing of single-subject contrast files prior to general linear model random-effects group analysis generating statistical parametric maps. Five regions of interest were defined, and several parameters (coordinates of nearest local maxima, t value, corrected threshold, effect size, residual values, etc.) were evaluated to examine the effects of spatial smoothing. The optimal filter size for group analysis is discussed according to various criteria. For our experiment, the optimal FWHM is about 8 mm. We can conclude that for robust experiments and an adequate number of subjects in the study, the optimal FWHM for single-subject inference is similar to that for group inference (about 8 mm, according to spatial resolution). For less robust experiments and fewer subjects in the study, a higher FWHM would be optimal for group inference than for single-subject inferences.},

abstract = {While many advanced mixed-effects models have been proposed and are used in fMRI, the simplest, ordinary least squares (OLS), is still the one that is most widely used. A survey of 90 papers found that 92{\%} of group fMRI analyses used OLS. Despite the widespread use, this simple approach has never been thoroughly justified and evaluated; for example, the typical reference for the method is a conference abstract, (Holmes, A., Friston, K., 1998. Generalisability, random effects {\&} population inference. NeuroImage 7 (4 (2/3)), S754, proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 7-12, 1998, Montreal, Canada.), which has been referenced over 400 times. In this work we fully derive the simplified method in a general setting and carefully identify the homogeneity assumptions it is based on. We examine the specificity (Type I error rate) of the OLS method under heterogeneity in the one-sample case and find that the OLS method is valid, with only slight conservativeness. Surprisingly, a Satterthwaite approximation for effective degrees of freedom only makes the method more conservative, instead of more accurate. While other authors have highlighted the inferior power of the OLS method relative to optimal mixed-effects methods under heterogeneity, we revisit these results and find the power differences very modest. While statistical methods that make the best use of the data are always to be preferred, software or other practical concerns may require the use of the simple OLS group modeling.

abstract = {Although there are a number of statistical software tools for voxel-based massively univariate analysis of neuroimaging data, such as fMRI (functional MRI), PET (positron emission tomography), and VBM (voxel-based morphometry), very few software tools exist for power and sample size calculation for neuroimaging studies. Unlike typical biomedical studies, outcomes from neuroimaging studies are 3D images of correlated voxels, requiring a correction for massive multiple comparisons. Thus, a specialized power calculation tool is needed for planning neuroimaging studies. To facilitate this process, we developed a software tool specifically designed for neuroimaging data. The software tool, called PowerMap, implements theoretical power calculation algorithms based on non-central random field theory. It can also calculate power for statistical analyses with FDR (false discovery rate) corrections. This GUI (graphical user interface)-based tool enables neuroimaging researchers without advanced knowledge in imaging statistics to calculate power and sample size in the form of 3D images. In this paper, we provide an overview of the statistical framework behind the PowerMap tool. Three worked examples are also provided, a regression analysis, an ANOVA (analysis of variance), and a two-sample T-test, in order to demonstrate the study planning process with PowerMap. We envision that PowerMap will be a great aide for future neuroimaging research.},

abstract = {Sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia patients has been well-documented. However, a central conceptual issue, regarding whether the gating deficit results from an abnormal initial response (S1) or difficulty in attenuating the response to the repeating stimulus (S2), raise doubts about the validity and utility of the S2/S1 ratio as a measure of sensory gating. This meta-analysis study, therefore, sought to determine the consistency and relative magnitude of the effect of the two essential components (S1 and S2) and the ratio. The results of weighted random effects meta-analysis revealed that the overall effect sizes for the S1 amplitude, S2 amplitude, and P50 S2/S1 ratio were -0.19 (small), 0.65 (medium to large), and 0.93 (large), respectively. These results confirm that the S2/S1 ratio and the repeating (S2) stimulus differ robustly between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in contrast to the consistent but smaller effect size for the S1 amplitude. These findings are more likely to reflect defective inhibition of repeating redundant input rather than an abnormal response to novel stimuli.},

abstract = {When planning most scientific studies, one of the first steps is to carry out a power analysis to define a design and sample size that will result in a well-powered study. There are limited resources for calculating power for group fMRI studies due to the complexity of the model. Previous approaches for group fMRI power calculation simplify the study design and/or the variance structure in order to make the calculation possible. These approaches limit the designs that can be studied and may result in inaccurate power calculations. We introduce a flexible power calculation model that makes fewer simplifying assumptions, leading to a more accurate power analysis that can be used on a wide variety of study designs. Our power calculation model can be used to obtain region of interest (ROI) summaries of the mean parameters and variance parameters, which can be use to increase understanding of the data as well as calculate power for a future study. Our example illustrates that minimizing cost to achieve 80{\%} power is not as simple as finding the smallest sample size capable of achieving 80{\%} power, since smaller sample sizes require each subject to be scanned longer.},

For example, for a blocked design with conditions A or B, fixed block length and block order ABN, where N denotes a null block, the optimal number of cycles of ABN and the optimal number of subjects have to be determined. This paper presents a method to determine the optimal number of subjects and optimal number of cycles for a blocked design based on the A-optimality criterion and a linear cost function by which the number of cycles and the number of subjects are restricted. Estimation of individual stimulus effects and estimation of contrasts between stimulus effects are both considered. The mixed-effects model is applied and analytical results for the A-optimal number of subjects and A-optimal number of cycles are obtained under the assumption of uncorrelated errors. For correlated errors with a first-order autoregressive (AR1) error structure, numerical results are presented. Our results show how the optimal number of cycles and subjects depend on the within- to between-subject variance ratio. Our method is a new approach to determine the optimal scanning time and optimal number of subjects for a multi-subject fMRI experiment. In contrast to previous results based on power analyses, the optimal number of cycles and subjects can be described analytically and costs are considered.},

abstract = {Replication of research findings is critical to the progress of scientific understanding. Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent fMRI articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among fMRI studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

But larger studies are actually better at protecting against inferences from trivial effect sizes, if researchers just make use of effect sizes and confidence intervals. Poor statistical power also comes at a cost of inflated proportion of false positive findings, less power to "confirm" true effects and bias in reported (inflated) effect sizes. Small studies (n=16) lack the precision to reliably distinguish small and medium to large effect sizes (r{\textless}.50) from random noise ($\alpha$=.05) that larger studies (n=100) does with high level of confidence (r=.50, p=.00000012).

abstract = {Two questions arising in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during periodic sensory stimulation are: i) how to measure the experimentally determined effect in fMRI time series; and ii) how to decide whether an apparent effect is significant. Our approach is first to fit a time series regression model, including sine and cosine terms at the (fundamental) frequency of experimental stimulation, by pseudogeneralized least squares (PGLS) at each pixel of an image. Sinusoidal modeling takes account of locally variable hemodynamic delay and dispersion, and PGLS fitting corrects for residual or endogenous autocorrelation in fMRI time series, to yield best unbiased estimates of the amplitudes of the sine and cosine terms at fundamental frequency; from these parameters the authors derive estimates of experimentally determined power and its standard error. Randomization testing is then used to create inferential brain activation maps (BAMs) of pixels significantly activated by the experimental stimulus. The methods are illustrated by application to data acquired from normal human subjects during periodic visual and auditory stimulation.},

abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon{\_}1000/.},

abstract = {Parametric statistical methods, such as Z-, t-, and F-values, are traditionally employed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for identifying areas in the brain that are active with a certain degree of statistical significance. These parametric methods, however, have two major drawbacks. First, it is assumed that the observed data are Gaussian distributed and independent; assumptions that generally are not valid for fMRI data. Second, the statistical test distribution can be derived theoretically only for very simple linear detection statistics. With nonparametric statistical methods, the two limitations described above can be overcome. The major drawback of non-parametric methods is the computational burden with processing times ranging from hours to days, which so far have made them impractical for routine use in single-subject fMRI analysis. In this work, it is shown how the computational power of cost-efficient graphics processing units (GPUs) can be used to speed up random permutation tests. A test with 10000 permutations takes less than a minute, making statistical analysis of advanced detection methods in fMRI practically feasible. To exemplify the permutation-based approach, brain activity maps generated by the general linear model (GLM) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) are compared at the same significance level.},

abstract = {The validity of parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis has only been reported for simulated data. Recent advances in computer science and data sharing make it possible to analyze large amounts of real fMRI data. In this study, 1484 rest datasets have been analyzed in SPM8, to estimate true familywise error rates. For a familywise significance threshold of 5{\%}, significant activity was found in 1{\%}-70{\%} of the 1484 rest datasets, depending on repetition time, paradigm and parameter settings. This means that parametric significance thresholds in SPM both can be conservative or very liberal. The main reason for the high familywise error rates seems to be that the global AR(1) auto correlation correction in SPM fails to model the spectra of the residuals, especially for short repetition times. The findings that are reported in this study cannot be generalized to parametric fMRI analysis in general, other software packages may give different results. By using the computational power of the graphics processing unit (GPU), the 1484 rest datasets were also analyzed with a random permutation test. Significant activity was then found in 1{\%}-19{\%} of the datasets. These findings speak to the need for a better model of temporal correlations in fMRI timeseries.},

@article{Ioannidis2005,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Mixture models are often used in the statistical segmentation of medical images. For example, they can be used for the segmentation of structural images into different matter types or of functional statistical parametric maps (SPMs) into activations and nonactivations. Nonspatial mixture models segment using models of just the histogram of intensity values. Spatial mixture models have also been developed which augment this histogram information with spatial regularization using Markov random fields. However, these techniques have control parameters, such as the strength of spatial regularization, which need to be tuned heuristically to particular datasets. We present a novel spatial mixture model within a fully Bayesian framework with the ability to perform fully adaptive spatial regularization using Markov random fields. This means that the amount of spatial regularization does not have to be tuned heuristically but is adaptively determined from the data. We examine the behavior of this model when applied to artificial data with different spatial characteristics, and to functional magnetic resonance imaging SPMs.},

We start by considering important logical properties and then discuss three different concepts of monotonicity. Afterwards we have a closer look at the recently proposed "fallback procedure" and show that it has some less appealing properties.

abstract = {The brain is the body's largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding tasks. Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95{\%} of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.},

abstract = {Despite its immediate success as a tool for basic research, the clinical application of functional MRI(fMRI) is still limited. FMRI has proven useful for presurgical functional mapping of the eloquent cortices. Localization of the sensorimotor cortex by fMRI may be of relatively limited value because the sensorimotor cortex can often be readily localized by means of anatomical methods. In contrast, the language cortices may not be localized anatomically and the language dominant hemisphere has been determined by invasive Wada test. Previous reports have shown that fMRI can be a promising alternative to the Wada test. A recent clinical trial has suggested that fMRI can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stage, detecting subclinical deterioration of the memory function. FMRI may be useful to predict the future decline of memory in people with genetic risks. Monitoring of the functional recovery of post-stroke brains may be another promising clinical application of fMRI. FMRI has demonstrated functional reorganization of the brain that may be related to the restoration of motor and language functions.},

We review some essential processes and assumptions of BOLD fMRI and discuss related confounds and pitfalls in fMRI - from the underlying physiological effect, to data acquisition, data analysis and the interpretation of the results including clinical fMRI.

Multiple regression analyses showed that fMRI provided the strongest independent predictor of memory outcome after surgery.

@article{Evans2012,
abstract = {The core concept within the field of brain mapping is the use of a standardized, or "stereotaxic", 3D coordinate frame for data analysis and reporting of findings from neuroimaging experiments. This simple construct allows brain researchers to combine data from many subjects such that group-averaged signals, be they structural or functional, can be detected above the background noise that would swamp subtle signals from any single subject. Where the signal is robust enough to be detected in individuals, it allows for the exploration of inter-individual variance in the location of that signal. From a larger perspective, it provides a powerful medium for comparison and/or combination of brain mapping findings from different imaging modalities and laboratories around the world. Finally, it provides a framework for the creation of large-scale neuroimaging databases or "atlases" that capture the population mean and variance in anatomical or physiological metrics as a function of age or disease. However, while the above benefits are not in question at first order, there are a number of conceptual and practical challenges that introduce second-order incompatibilities among experimental data. Stereotaxic mapping requires two basic components: (i) the specification of the 3D stereotaxic coordinate space, and (ii) a mapping function that transforms a 3D brain image from "native" space, i.e. the coordinate frame of the scanner at data acquisition, to that stereotaxic space. The first component is usually expressed by the choice of a representative 3D MR image that serves as target "template" or atlas. The native image is re-sampled from native to stereotaxic space under the mapping function that may have few or many degrees of freedom, depending upon the experimental design. The optimal choice of atlas template and mapping function depend upon considerations of age, gender, hemispheric asymmetry, anatomical correspondence, spatial normalization methodology and disease-specificity. Accounting, or not, for these various factors in defining stereotaxic space has created the specter of an ever-expanding set of atlases, customized for a particular experiment, that are mutually incompatible. These difficulties continue to plague the brain mapping field. This review article summarizes the evolution of stereotaxic space in term of the basic principles and associated conceptual challenges, the creation of population atlases and the future trends that can be expected in atlas evolution.},

In this article we will consider some of the early forays into Bayes and what motivated its use. We shall see the impact that Bayes has had on haemodynamic modelling, spatial modelling, group analysis, model selection and brain connectivity analysis; and consider how these advancements have spun-off into related areas of neuroscience and some of the challenges that remain. Bayes has brought to the table inference flexibility, incorporation of prior information, adaptive regularisation and model selection. But perhaps more important than these things, is the ability of Bayes to empower the methods researcher with a mathematically principled framework for inferring on any model.},

@article{Silver2011,
abstract = {Voxel-wise statistical inference is commonly used to identify significant experimental effects or group differences in both functional and structural studies of the living brain. Tests based on the size of spatially extended clusters of contiguous suprathreshold voxels are also widely used due to their typically increased statistical power. In "imaging genetics", such tests are used to identify regions of the brain that are associated with genetic variation. However, concerns have been raised about the adequate control of rejection rates in studies of this type. A previous study tested the effect of a set of 'null' SNPs on brain structure and function, and found that false positive rates were well-controlled. However, no similar analysis of false positive rates in an imaging genetic study using cluster size inference has yet been undertaken. We measured false positive rates in an investigation of the effect of 700 pre-selected null SNPs on grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). As VBM data exhibit spatially-varying smoothness, we used both non-stationary and stationary cluster size tests in our analysis. Image and genotype data on 181 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). At a nominal significance level of 5{\%}, false positive rates were found to be well-controlled (3.9-5.6{\%}), using a relatively high cluster-forming threshold, $\alpha$(c)=0.001, on images smoothed with a 12 mm Gaussian kernel. Tests were however anticonservative at lower cluster-forming thresholds ($\alpha$(c)=0.01, 0.05), and for images smoothed using a 6mm Gaussian kernel. Here false positive rates ranged from 9.8 to 67.6{\%}. In a further analysis, false positive rates using simulated data were observed to be well-controlled across a wide range of conditions. While motivated by imaging genetics, our findings apply to any VBM study, and suggest that parametric cluster size inference should only be used with high cluster-forming thresholds and smoothness. We would advocate the use of nonparametric methods in other cases.},

abstract = {A new method for detecting activations in random fields, which may be useful for addressing the issue of multiple comparisons in neuroimaging, is presented. This method is based on some constructs of mathematical morphology - specifically, morphological erosions and dilations - that enable the detection of active regions in random fields possessing moderate activation levels and relatively large spatial extension, which may not be detected by the standard methods that control the family-wise error rate. The method presented here permits an appropriate control of the false positive errors, without having to adjust any threshold values, other than the significance level. The method is easily adapted to permutation-based procedures (with the usual restrictions), and therefore does not require strong assumptions about the distribution and spatio-temporal correlation structure of the data. Some examples of applications to synthetic data, including realistic fMRI simulations, as well as to real fMRI and electroencephalographic data are presented, illustrating the power of the presented technique. Comparisons with other methods that combine voxel intensity and cluster size, as well as some extensions of the method presented here based on their basic ideas are presented as well.},

abstract = {Artifacts in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, primarily those related to motion and physiological sources, negatively impact the functional signal-to-noise ratio in fMRI studies, even after conventional fMRI preprocessing. Independent component analysis' demonstrated capacity to separate sources of neural signal, structured noise, and random noise into separate components might be utilized in improved procedures to remove artifacts from fMRI data. Such procedures require a method for labeling independent components (ICs) as representing artifacts to be removed or neural signals of interest to be spared. Visual inspection is often considered an accurate method for such labeling as well as a standard to which automated labeling methods are compared. However, detailed descriptions of methods for visual inspection of ICs are lacking in the literature. Here we describe the details of, and the rationale for, an operationalized fMRI data denoising procedure that involves visual inspection of ICs (96{\%} inter-rater agreement). We estimate that dozens of subjects/sessions can be processed within a few hours using the described method of visual inspection. Our hope is that continued scientific discussion of and testing of visual inspection methods will lead to the development of improved, cost-effective fMRI denoising procedures.},

Surgical resection of the left hippocampus in this setting can cure seizures, but may produce significant verbal memory decline, which is hard to predict. We report 10 right-handed TLE patients with left hippocampal sclerosis who underwent left hippocampal resection. We compared currently used data for the prediction of post-operative verbal memory decline in such patients with a novel fMRI assessment of verbal memory encoding. Multiple regression analyses showed that fMRI provided the strongest independent predictor of memory outcome after surgery. At the individual subject level, the fMRI data had high positive predictive value for memory decline.},

abstract = {Medically refractory focal epilepsy is potentially curable by surgery. This Review considers the application of recent advances in structural and functional brain imaging to increase the number of patients with epilepsy who are treated surgically, and to reduce the risk of complications arising from such intervention. Current optimal MRI of brain structure can identify previously undetectable lesions, with voxel-based and quantitative analyses further increasing the diagnostic yield. If MRI proves unremarkable, PET (with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose) and single-photon emission CT of ictal-interictal cerebral blood flow might identify the brain region that contains the epileptic focus. Magnetoencephalography plus simultaneous EEG and functional MRI can map the location of interictal epileptic discharges, thereby facilitating placement of intracranial recording electrodes to define the site of seizure onset. Functional MRI can also lateralize language and localize primary motor, somatosensory and language areas, and shows promise for predicting the effects of temporal lobe resection on memory. Tractography can visualize the main cerebral white matter tracts, thereby predicting and reducing surgery risk. Currently, displays of the optic radiation and pyramidal tracts are the most relevant for epilepsy surgery. Reliable integration of structural and functional data into surgical image-guidance systems is being pursued, and promises safer neurosurgery for epilepsy in the future.},

Two recent studies demonstrate that preoperative fMRI can predict postoperative naming and verbal memory changes in such patients. Most importantly, fMRI significantly improves the accuracy of prediction relative to other noninvasive measures used alone. Addition of language and memory lateralization data from the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test did not improve prediction accuracy in these studies.

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a valuable technique for the multivariate data-driven analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets. Applications of ICA have been developed mainly for single subject studies, although different solutions for group studies have been proposed. These approaches combine data sets from multiple subjects into a single aggregate data set before ICA estimation and, thus, require some additional assumptions about the separability across subjects of group independent components. Here, we exploit the application of similarity measures and a related visual tool to study the natural self-organizing clustering of many independent components from multiple individual data sets in the subject space. Our proposed framework flexibly enables multiple criteria for the generation of group independent components and their random-effects evaluation. We present real visual activation fMRI data from two experiments, with different spatiotemporal structures, and demonstrate the validity of this framework for a blind extraction and selection of meaningful activity and functional connectivity group patterns. Our approach is either alternative or complementary to the group ICA of aggregated data sets in that it exploits commonalities across multiple subject-specific patterns, while addressing as much as possible of the intersubject variability of the measured responses. This property is particularly of interest for a blind group and subgroup pattern extraction and selection.},

In our model, we assume that the Z-score image from a patient can be segmented into activated, deactivated, and null classes, or states. Conditional on the class, or state, the Z-scores are assumed to come from some generic distribution which we model non-parametrically using a mixture of Dirichlet process priors within the Bayesian framework. The posterior distribution of the model parameters is estimated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and Bayesian decision theory is used to make the final classifications. Our Potts prior model includes two parameters, the standard spatial regularization parameter and a parameter that can be interpreted as the a priori probability that each voxel belongs to the null, or background state, conditional on the lack of spatial regularization. We assume that both of these parameters are unknown, and jointly estimate them along with other model parameters. We show through simulation studies that our model performs on par, in terms of posterior expected loss, with parametric Potts models when the parametric model is correctly specified and outperforms parametric models when the parametric model in misspecified.},

abstract = {We consider large-scale studies in which there are hundreds or thousands of correlated cases to investigate, each represented by its own normal variate, typically a z-value. A familiar example is provided by a microarray experiment comparing healthy with sick subjects' expression levels for thousands of genes. This paper concerns the accuracy of summary statistics for the collection of normal variates, such as their empirical cdf or a false discovery rate statistic. It seems like we must estimate an N by N correlation matrix, N the number of cases, but our main result shows that this is not necessary: good accuracy approximations can be based on the root mean square correlation over all N {\textperiodcentered} (N - 1)/2 pairs, a quantity often easily estimated. A second result shows that z-values closely follow normal distributions even under non-null conditions, supporting application of the main theorem. Practical application of the theory is illustrated for a large leukemia microarray study.},

@article{Hayasaka2004b,
abstract = {In a massively univariate analysis of brain image data, statistical inference is typically based on intensity or spatial extent of signals. Voxel intensity-based tests provide great sensitivity for high intensity signals, whereas cluster extent-based tests are sensitive to spatially extended signals. To benefit from the strength of both, the intensity and extent information needs to be combined. Various ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent are possible, and a few such combining methods have been proposed. Poline et al.'s [NeuroImage 16 (1997) 83] minimum P value approach is sensitive to signals whose either intensity or extent is significant. Bullmore et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 18 (1999) 32] cluster mass method can detect signals whose intensity and extent are sufficiently large, even when they are not significant by intensity or extent alone. In this work, we study such combined inference methods using combining functions (Pesarin, F., 2001. Multivariate Permutation Tests. Wiley, New York) and permutation framework [Holmes et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7], which allow us to examine different ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent information without knowing their distribution. We also attempt to calibrate combined inference by using weighted combining functions, which adjust the test according to signals of interest. Furthermore, we propose meta-combining, a combining function of combining functions, which integrates strengths of multiple combining functions into a single statistic. We found that combined tests are able to detect signals that are not detected by voxel or cluster size test alone. We also found that the weighted combining functions can calibrate the combined test according to the signals of interest, emphasizing either intensity or extent as appropriate. Though not necessarily more sensitive than individual combining functions, the meta-combining function is sensitive to all types of signals and thus can be used as a single test summarizing all the combining functions.},

@article{Wilke2012a,
abstract = {For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) group activation maps, so-called second-level random effect approaches are commonly used, which are intended to be generalizable to the population as a whole. However, reliability of a certain activation focus as a function of group composition or group size cannot directly be deduced from such maps. This question is of particular relevance when examining smaller groups ({\textless}20-27 subjects). The approach presented here tries to address this issue by iteratively excluding each subject from a group study and presenting the overlap of the resulting (reduced) second-level maps in a group percent overlap map. This allows to judge where activation is reliable even upon excluding one, two, or three (or more) subjects, thereby also demonstrating the inherent variability that is still present in second-level analyses. Moreover, when progressively decreasing group size, foci of activation will become smaller and/or disappear; hence, the group size at which a given activation disappears can be considered to reflect the power necessary to detect this particular activation. Systematically exploiting this effect allows to rank clusters according to their observable effect size. The approach is tested using different scenarios from a recent fMRI study (children performing a "dual-use" fMRI task, n = 39), and the implications of this approach are discussed.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in brain imaging research (neuroimaging) to explore structural and functional changes across dispersed neural networks visible only via multisubject experiments. Multicenter investigations are an effective way to increase recruitment rates. This article describes image-based power calculations for a two-group, cross-sectional design specified by the mean effect size and its standard error, sample size, false discovery rate (FDR), and size of the network (i.e., proportion of image locations) that truly demonstrates an effect. Minimum sample size (for fixed effect size) and the minimum effect size (for fixed sample size) are calculated by specifying the acceptable power threshold. Within-center variance was estimated in five participating centers by repeat MRI scanning of 12 healthy participants from whom distributions of gray matter were estimated. The effect on outcome measures when varying FDR and the proportion of true positives is presented. Their spatial patterns reflect within-center variance, which is consistent across centers. Sample sizes 3-6 times larger are needed when detecting effects in subcortical regions compared to the neocortex. Hypothesized multicenter studies of patients with first episode psychosis and control participants were simulated with varying proportions of the cohort recruited at each center. There is little penalty to sample size for recruitment at five centers compared to the center with the lowest variance alone. At 80{\%} power 80 participants per group are required to observe differences in gray matter in high variance regions.},

@article{VanHorn1998,
abstract = {Using a classic technique based on the noncentral F-distribution method for computing statistical power, we developed a general approach to the estimation of voxel-based power in functional brain image data analysis. We applied this method to PET data from a large sample (N = 40) of subjects performing the Wisconsin Card Sorting (WCST) paradigm analyzed with SPM95, produced statistical power maps for a range of samples sizes and smoothing filter widths, and examined the effects of sample size and image smoothing on the expected reliability of activation findings. At an uncorrected alpha of 0.01, a fixed filter size of 10 mm3, and a range of power thresholds, maps revealed that the power to reject the null hypothesis in brain regions implicated in the task at Ns of 5 and 10 may not be sufficient to ensure reliable replication of significant findings and so should be interpreted with caution. At sample sizes approaching 20 subjects, sufficient power was found in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46/9), right and left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), and left inferior temporal lobe (BA 37), comprising the cortical network typically observed during the WCST. Filter size needed to maximize power varied widely, but systematically, across the brain, tending to follow known neuroanatomical landmarks. Statistical power considerations in brain imaging studies are critical for controlling the rate of false negatives and assuring reliable detection of cognitive activation. The variation of filter size for maximizing power across the brain suggests that the underlying neuroanatomy of functional units is an important consideration in the a priori selection of filter size.},

This is perhaps due to the fact that the consideration of type II error requires the specification of an alternative hypothesis/experimental effect. In this paper, we present a method for expressing experimental effects in fMRI in a manner relative to a reference effect. A reference effect is chosen based on its neurophysiological significance to the researcher. This method provides a means to quantitatively express alternative hypotheses for fMRI, thus allowing type II error assessment prior to the collection of fMRI data. The simultaneous control of both type I and type II error should make meaningful interpretations possible from both positive and negative fMRI results.},

abstract = {This article shows that any single-step or stepwise multiple testing procedure (asymptotically) controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) can be augmented into procedures that (asymptotically) control tail probabilities for the number of false positives and the proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses. Specifically, given any procedure that (asymptotically) controls the FWER at level alpha, we propose simple augmentation procedures that provide (asymptotic) level-alpha control of: (i) the generalized family-wise error rate, i.e., the tail probability, gFWER(k), that the number of Type I errors exceeds a user-supplied integer k, and (ii) the tail probability, TPPFP(q), that the proportion of Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses exceeds a user-supplied value 0{\textless}q{\textless}1. Existing approaches for control of the proportion of false positives typically rely on the assumption that the test statistics are independent, while our proposed augmentation procedures control the gFWER and TPPFP for general data generating distributions, with arbitrary dependence structures among variables. Applying the augmentation methods to step-down multiple testing procedures that control the FWER asymptotically exactly at level alpha (van der Laan et al., 2004), yields procedures that also provide exact asymptotic control of the gFWER and TPPFP at level alpha. The adjusted p-values for the gFWER and TPPFP-controlling augmentation procedures are shown to be simple functions of the adjusted p-values for the original FWER-controlling procedure. Finally, two simple conservative procedures are proposed for controlling the false discovery rate.},

abstract = {We comparedthe characteristics of the visually evoked hemodynamic response (HDR) in groups of young and elderly adults. Checkerboard stimuli were presented for 500 ms either singly or in pairs separated by a 2-s intrapair interval while gradient-echo echoplanar fMRI images were acquired concurrently every 1 s. Activated voxels, identified by correlation with an empirically derived reference waveform, were found for both groups in cortex along the calcarine sulcus and in the fusiform gyrus, with the mean HDR latency in calcarine cortex peaking approximately 300 ms earlier than the HDR evoked in the fusiform gyrus. On average, younger subjects had twice as many activated voxels as older subjects. The mean HDR had a similar onset time, rate of rise, and peak amplitude in both groups. However, the HDRs of older subjects reached their peak earlier and were more variable across subjects. Despite having average HDR amplitudes similar to those of younger subjects, older subjects had higher noise levels in activated voxels, resulting in lower signal-to-noise ratios. Distribution analyses of voxel statistics (t value, peak amplitude, peak latency) revealed that older subjects had proportionally fewer small-effect-size voxels, due to their increased voxelwise noise. This finding was consistent with the smaller spatial extent of activation in older subjects. To investigate age differences in the refractory period of the visual HDR, the HDR evoked by the second stimulus of each pair was isolated by subtracting the HDR evoked by a single stimulus from the composite HDR evoked by a pair. Recovery measures were similar across the age groups.},

abstract = {Interdependent cultures (such as the Chinese) and independent cultures (such as the German) differ in their attitude towards harmony that is more valued in interdependent cultures. Interdependent and independent cultures also differ in their appreciation of anger - an emotion that implies the disruption of harmony. The present study investigated if interdependent and independent cultures foster distinct brain activity associated with empathic processing of familiar angry, familiar neutral, and unfamiliar neutral faces. Using functional MRI, we scanned Chinese and German healthy subjects during an intentional empathy task, a control task (the evaluation of skin color), and a baseline condition. The subject groups were matched with regard to age, gender, and education. Behaviorally, Chinese subjects described themselves as significantly more interdependent compared to German subjects. The contrast 'intentional empathy for familiar angry'{\textgreater}'baseline' revealed several regions, including the left inferior frontal cortex, the left supplementary motor area, and the left insula, that showed comparable hemodynamic responses in both groups. However, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex had stronger hemodynamic responses in Chinese subjects in the contrast 'intentional empathy for familiar angry'{\textgreater}'baseline'. Germans, in contrast, showed stronger hemodynamic responses in the right temporo-parietal junction, right inferior and superior temporal gyrus, and left middle insula for the same contrast. Hemodynamic responses in the latter three brain regions correlated with interdependences scores over all subjects. Our results suggest that enhanced emotion regulation during empathy with anger in the interdependent lifestyle is mediated by the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Increased tolerance towards the expression of anger in the independent lifestyle, in contrast, is associated with increased activity of the right inferior and superior temporal gyrus and the left middle insula.},

abstract = {A new procedure is proposed to balance type I and II errors in significance testing for differential expression of individual genes. Suppose that a collection, F(k), of k lists of selected genes is available, each of them approximating by their content the true set of differentially expressed genes. For example, such sets can be generated by a subsampling counterpart of the delete-d-jackknife method controlling the per-comparison error rate for each subsample. A final list of candidate genes, denoted by S(*), is composed in such a way that its contents be closest in some sense to all the sets thus generated. To measure "closeness" of gene lists, we introduce an asymmetric distance between sets with its asymmetry arising from a generally unequal assignment of the relative costs of type I and type II errors committed in the course of gene selection. The optimal set S(*) is defined as a minimizer of the average asymmetric distance from an arbitrary set S to all sets in the collection F(k). The minimization problem can be solved explicitly, leading to a frequency criterion for the inclusion of each gene in the final set. The proposed method is tested by resampling from real microarray gene expression data with artificially introduced shifts in expression levels of pre-defined genes, thereby mimicking their differential expression.},

abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is widely used as a high-resolution approach to understanding the relationship between anatomical structures and variables of interest. Controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) is an attractive choice for thresholding the resulting statistical maps and has been commonly used in fMRI studies. However, we caution against the use of nonadaptive FDR control procedures, such as the most commonly used Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (B-H), in VBM analyses. This is because, in VBM analyses, specific risk factors may be associated with volume change in a global, rather than local, manner, which means the proportion of truly associated voxels among all voxels is large. In such a case, the achieved FDR obtained by nonadaptive procedures can be substantially lower than the nominal, or controlled, level. Such conservatism deprives researchers of power for detecting true associations. In this article, we advocate for the use of adaptive FDR control in VBM-type analyses. Specifically, we examine two representative adaptive procedures: the two-stage step-up procedure by Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli (2006: Biometrika 93:491-507) and the procedure of Storey and Tibshirani ([2003]: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:9440-9445). We demonstrate mathematically, with simulations, and with a data example that these procedures provide improved performance over the B-H procedure.},

However, rigorous control of the FDR at a preselected level is often impractical. Consequently, it has been suggested to use the q-value as an estimate of the proportion of false discoveries among a set of significant findings. However, such an interpretation of the q-value may be unwarranted considering that the q-value is based on an unstable estimator of the positive FDR (pFDR). Another method proposes estimating the FDR by modeling p-values as arising from a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) distribution. Unfortunately, the BUM approach is reliable only in settings where the assumed model accurately represents the actual distribution of p-values.},

abstract = {When planning most scientific studies, one of the first steps is to carry out a power analysis to define a design and sample size that will result in a well-powered study. There are limited resources for calculating power for group fMRI studies due to the complexity of the model. Previous approaches for group fMRI power calculation simplify the study design and/or the variance structure in order to make the calculation possible. These approaches limit the designs that can be studied and may result in inaccurate power calculations. We introduce a flexible power calculation model that makes fewer simplifying assumptions, leading to a more accurate power analysis that can be used on a wide variety of study designs. Our power calculation model can be used to obtain region of interest (ROI) summaries of the mean parameters and variance parameters, which can be use to increase understanding of the data as well as calculate power for a future study.

abstract = {Nucleotide-microarray technology, which allows the simultaneous measurement of the expression of tens of thousands of genes, has become an important tool in the study of disease. In disorders such as malignancy, gene expression often undergoes broad changes of sizable magnitude, whereas in many common multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis, the changes in gene expression are modest. In the latter circumstance, it is therefore challenging to distinguish the truly changing from non-changing genes, especially because statistical significance must be considered in the context of multiple hypothesis testing. Here, we present a balanced probability analysis (BPA), which provides the biologist with an approach to interpret results in the context of the total number of genes truly differentially expressed and false discovery and false negative rates for the list of genes reaching any significance threshold. In situations where the changes are of modest magnitude, sole consideration of the false discovery rate can result in poor power to detect genes truly differentially expressed. Concomitant analysis of the rate of truly differentially expressed genes not identified, i.e., the false negative rate, allows balancing of the two error rates and a more thorough insight into the data. To this end, we have developed a unique, model-based procedure for the estimation of false negative rates, which allows application of BPA to real data in which changes are modest.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {An incredible amount of data is generated in the course of a functional neuroimaging experiment. The quantity of data gives us improved temporal and spatial resolution with which to evaluate our results. It also creates a staggering multiple testing problem. A number of methods have been created that address the multiple testing problem in neuroimaging in a principled fashion. These methods place limits on either the familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) of the results. These principled approaches are well established in the literature and are known to properly limit the amount of false positives across the whole brain. However, a minority of papers are still published every month using methods that are improperly corrected for the number of tests conducted. These latter methods place limits on the voxelwise probability of a false positive and yield no information on the global rate of false positives in the results. In this commentary, we argue in favor of a principled approach to the multiple testing problem--one that places appropriate limits on the rate of false positives across the whole brain gives readers the information they need to properly evaluate the results.},

@article{Lieberman2009,
abstract = {Statistical thresholding (i.e. P-values) in fMRI research has become increasingly conservative over the past decade in an attempt to diminish Type I errors (i.e. false alarms) to a level traditionally allowed in behavioral science research. In this article, we examine the unintended negative consequences of this single-minded devotion to Type I errors: increased Type II errors (i.e. missing true effects), a bias toward studying large rather than small effects, a bias toward observing sensory and motor processes rather than complex cognitive and affective processes and deficient meta-analyses. Power analyses indicate that the reductions in acceptable P-values over time are producing dramatic increases in the Type II error rate. Moreover, the push for a mapwide false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 is based on the assumption that this is the FDR in most behavioral research; however, this is an inaccurate assessment of the conventions in actual behavioral research. We report simulations demonstrating that combined intensity and cluster size thresholds such as P {\textless} 0.005 with a 10 voxel extent produce a desirable balance between Types I and II error rates. This joint threshold produces high but acceptable Type II error rates and produces a FDR that is comparable to the effective FDR in typical behavioral science articles (while a 20 voxel extent threshold produces an actual FDR of 0.05 with relatively common imaging parameters). We recommend a greater focus on replication and meta-analysis rather than emphasizing single studies as the unit of analysis for establishing scientific truth. From this perspective, Type I errors are self-erasing because they will not replicate, thus allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid Type II errors.},

@article{Smith2009,
abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

abstract = {The complicated structure of fMRI signals and associated noise sources make it difficult to assess the validity of various steps involved in the statistical analysis of brain activation. Most methods used for fMRI analysis assume that observations are independent and that the noise can be treated as white gaussian noise. These assumptions are usually not true but it is difficult to assess how severely these assumptions are violated and what are their practical consequences. In this study a direct comparison is made between the power of various analytical methods used to detect activations, without reference to estimates of statistical significance. The statistics used in fMRI are treated as metrics designed to detect activations and are not interpreted probabilistically. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method is used to compare the efficacy of various steps in calculating an activation map in the study of a single subject based on optimizing the ratio of the number of detected activations to the number of false-positive findings. The main findings are as follows: Preprocessing. The removal of intensity drifts and high-pass filtering applied on the voxel time-course level is beneficial to the efficacy of analysis. Temporal normalization of the global image intensity, smoothing in the temporal domain, and low-pass filtering do not improve power of analysis. Choices of statistics. the cross-correlation coefficient and t-statistic, as well as nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistics, prove to be the most effective and are similar in performance, by our criterion. Task design. the proper design of task protocols is shown to be crucial. In an alternating block design the optimal block length is be approximately 18 s. Spatial clustering. an initial spatial smoothing of images is more efficient than cluster filtering of the statistical parametric activation maps.},

abstract = {Many fMRI experiments have a common objective of identifying active voxels in a neuroimaging dataset. This is done in single subject experiments, for example, by performing individual voxel-wise tests of the null hypothesis that the observed time course is not significantly related to an assigned reference function. A voxel activation map is then constructed by applying a thresholding rule to the resulting statistics (e.g., t-statistics). Typically the task-related activation is expected to occur in clusters of voxels rather than in isolated single voxels. A variety of spatial thresholding techniques have been proposed to reflect this belief, including smoothing the raw t-statistics, cluster size inference, and spatial mixture modeling. We study two aspects of these spatial thresholding procedures applied to single subject fMRI analysis through simulation. First, we examine the performance of these procedures in terms of sensitivity to detect voxel activation, using receiver operating characteristic curves. Second, we consider the accuracy of these spatial thresholding procedures in estimation of the size of the activation region, both in terms of bias and variance. The findings indicate that smoothing has the highest sensitivity to modest magnitude signals, but tend to overestimate the size of the activation region. Spatial mixture models estimate the size of a spatially distributed activation region well, but may be less sensitive to modest magnitude signals, indicating that additional research into more sensitive spatial mixture models is needed. Finally, the methods are illustrated with a real bilateral finger-tapping fMRI experiment.},

abstract = {Approaches for the analysis of statistical parametric maps (SPMs) can be crudely grouped into three main categories in which different philosophies are applied to delineate activated regions. These being type I error control thresholding, false discovery rate (FDR) control thresholding and posterior probability thresholding. To better understand the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data sets. Using default settings, we find that posterior probability thresholding is the most powerful approach, and type I error control thresholding provides the lowest levels of type I error. False discovery rate control thresholding performs in between the other approaches for both these criteria, although for some parameter settings this approach can approximate the performance of posterior probability thresholding. Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal approach. We conclude that viewing the problem of delineating areas of activation as a classification problem provides a highly interpretable framework for comparing the methods. Within this framework, we highlight the role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of errors that may occur in a given analysis.},

abstract = {The problem of selecting a threshold for the statistical parameter maps in functional MRI (fMRI) is a delicate issue. The use of advanced test statistics and/or the complex dependence structure of fMRI noise may preclude parametric statistical methods for finding appropriate thresholds. Non-parametric statistical methodology has been presented as a feasible alternative. In this paper, we discuss resampling methods for finding thresholds in single subject fMRI analysis. It is shown that the presence of a BOLD response in the time series biases the estimation of the temporal autocorrelation, which in turn leads to biased thresholds. Therefore, proposed resampling methods based on Fourier and wavelet transforms, which employ implicit and weak models of the temporal noise characteristic, may produce erroneous thresholds. In contrast, resampling based on a pre-whitening transform, which is driven by an explicit noise model, is robust to the presence of a BOLD response. The size of the bias is, however, largely dependent on the complexity of the experimental design. While blocked designs can induce large biases, event-related designs generate significantly smaller biases. Results supporting these claims are provided.},

abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem. With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments.},

The advantages of this analysis over previous ones are both conceptual and statistical. Recognizing that the fundamental units of interest are the spatially contiguous clusters of voxels that are activated together, we set out to approximate these cluster units from the data by a clustering algorithm especially tailored for fMRI data. Testing the cluster units has a two-fold statistical advantage over testing each voxel separately: the signal to noise ratio within the unit tested is higher, and the number of hypotheses tests compared is smaller. We suggest controlling FDR on clusters, i.e., the proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected and explain the meaning of controlling this error rate. We introduce the powerful adaptive procedure to control the FDR on clusters. We apply our cluster-based analysis (CBA) to both an event-related and a block design fMRI vision experiment and demonstrate its increased power over voxel-by-voxel analysis in these examples as well as in simulations.},

abstract = {Computer simulations have played a critical role in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, notably in the validation of new data analysis methods. Many approaches have been used to generate fMRI simulations, but there is currently no generic framework to assess how realistic each one of these approaches may be. In this article, a statistical technique called parametric bootstrap was used to generate a simulation database that mimicked the parameters found in a real database, which comprised 40 subjects and five tasks. The simulations were evaluated by comparing the distributions of a battery of statistical measures between the real and simulated databases. Two popular simulation models were evaluated for the first time by applying the bootstrap framework. The first model was an additive mixture of multiple components and the second one implemented a non-linear motion process. In both models, the simulated components included the following brain dynamics: a baseline, physiological noise, neural activation and random noise. These models were found to successfully reproduce the relative variance of the components and the temporal autocorrelation of the fMRI time series. By contrast, the level of spatial autocorrelation was found to be drastically low using the additive model. Interestingly, the motion process in the second model intrisically generated some slow time drifts and increased the level of spatial autocorrelations. These experiments demonstrated that the bootstrap framework is a powerful new tool that can pinpoint the respective strengths and limitations of simulation models.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), plays an important role in identifying specific brain regions associated with experimental stimuli or psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. PET and fMRI produce massive data sets that contain both temporal correlations from repeated scans and complex spatial correlations. Several methods exist for handling temporal correlations, some of which rely on transforming the response data to induce either a known or an independence covariance structure. Despite the presence of spatial correlations between the volume elements (voxels) comprising a brain scan, conventional methods perform voxel-by-voxel analyses of measured brain activity. We propose a two-stage spatio-temporal model for the estimation and testing of localized activity. Our second-stage model specifies a spatial auto-regression, capturing correlations within neural processing clusters defined by a data-driven cluster analysis. We use maximum likelihood methods to estimate parameters from our spatial autoregressive model. Our model protects against type-I errors, enables the detection of both localized and regional activations (including volume of interest effects), provides information on functional connectivity in the brain, and establishes a framework to produce spatially smoothed maps of distributed brain activity for each individual. We illustrate the application of our model using PET data from a study of working memory in individuals with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Because of their increased sensitivity to spatially extended signals, cluster-size tests are widely used to detect changes and activations in brain images. However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives, while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT) method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780; Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions, is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and is robust [NeuroImage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to stationary permutation, stationary RFT, and nonstationary RFT methods. Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs well under any setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity, while both nonstationary RFT and permutation tests remain valid under nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary RFT cluster-size test.},

abstract = {We describe the use of random field and permutation methods to detect activation in cortically constrained maps of current density computed from MEG data. The methods are applicable to any inverse imaging method that maps event-related MEG to a coregistered cortical surface. These approaches also extend directly to images computed from event-related EEG data. We determine statistical thresholds that control the familywise error rate (FWER) across space or across both space and time. Both random field and permutation methods use the distribution of the maximum statistic under the null hypothesis to find FWER thresholds. The former methods make assumptions on the distribution and smoothness of the data and use approximate analytical solutions, the latter resample the data and rely on empirical distributions. Both methods account for spatial and temporal correlation in the cortical maps. Unlike previous nonparametric work in neuroimaging, we address the problem of nonuniform specificity that can arise without a Gaussianity assumption. We compare and evaluate the methods on simulated data and experimental data from a somatosensory-evoked response study. We find that the random field methods are conservative with or without smoothing, though with a 5 vertex FWHM smoothness, they are close to exact. Our permutation methods demonstrated exact specificity in simulation studies. In real data, the permutation method was not as sensitive as the RF method, although this could be due to violations of the random field theory assumptions.},

Cluster extent is sensitive to spatially extended signals while voxel intensity is better for intense but focal signals. In order to leverage strength from both statistics, several nonparametric permutation methods have been proposed to combine the two methods. Simulation studies have shown that of the different cluster permutation methods, the cluster mass statistic is generally the best. However, to date, there is no parametric cluster mass inference available. In this paper, we propose a cluster mass inference method based on random field theory (RFT). We develop this method for Gaussian images, evaluate it on Gaussian and Gaussianized t-statistic images and investigate its statistical properties via simulation studies and real data. Simulation results show that the method is valid under the null hypothesis and demonstrate that it can be more powerful than the cluster extent inference method. Further, analyses with a single subject and a group fMRI dataset demonstrate better power than traditional cluster size inference, and good accuracy relative to a gold-standard permutation test.},

abstract = {Recently, Everitt and Bullmore [1999] proposed a mixture model for a test statistic for activation in fMRI data. The distribution of the statistic was divided into two components; one for nonactivated voxels and one for activated voxels. In this framework one can calculate a posterior probability for a voxel being activated, which provides a more natural basis for thresholding the statistic image, than that based on P-values. In this article, we extend the method of Everitt and Bullmore to account for spatial coherency of activated regions. We achieve this by formulating a model for the activation in a small region of voxels and using this spatial structure when calculating the posterior probability of a voxel being activated. We have investigated several choices of spatial models but find that they all work equally well for brain imaging data. We applied the model to synthetic data from statistical image analysis, a synthetic fMRI data set and to visual stimulation data. Our conclusion is that the method improves the estimation of the activation pattern significantly, compared to the nonspatial model and to smoothing the data with a kernel of FWHM 3 voxels. The difference between FWHM 2 smoothing and our method were more modest.},

abstract = {Current strategies for thresholding statistical parametric maps in neuroimaging include control of the family-wise error rate, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) and thresholding of the posterior probability of a voxel being active given the data, the latter derived from a mixture model of active and inactive voxels. Correct inference using any of these criteria depends crucially on the specification of the null distribution of the test statistics. In this article we show examples from fMRI and DTI data where the theoretical null distribution does not match well the observed distribution of the test statistics. As a solution, we introduce the use of an empirical null, a null distribution empirically estimated from the data itself, allowing for global corrections of theoretical null assumptions. The theoretical null distributions considered are normal, t, chi(2) and F, all commonly encountered in neuroimaging. The empirical null estimate is accompanied by an estimate of the proportion of non-active voxels in the data. Based on the two-class mixture model, we present the equivalence between the strategies of controlling FDR and thresholding posterior probabilities in the context of neuroimaging and show that the FDR estimates derived from the empirical null can be seen as empirical Bayes estimates.},

@article{Nandy2007,
abstract = {One of the most important considerations in any hypothesis based fMRI data analysis is to choose the appropriate threshold to construct the activation maps, which is usually based on p-values. However, in fMRI data, there are three factors which necessitate severe corrections in the process of estimating the p-values. First, the fMRI time series at an individual voxel has strong temporal autocorrelation which needs to be estimated to obtain the corrected parametric p-value. The second factor is the multiple comparisons problem arising from simultaneously testing tens of thousands of voxels for activation. A common way in the statistical literature to account for multiple testing is to consider the family-wise error rate (FWE) which is related to the distribution of the maximum observed value over all voxels. The third problem, which is not mentioned frequently in the context of adjusting the p-value, is the effect of inherent low frequency processes present even in resting-state data that may introduce a large number of false positives without proper adjustment. In this article, a novel and efficient semi-parametric method, using resampling of normalized spacings of order statistics, is introduced to address all the three problems mentioned above. The new method makes very few assumptions and demands minimal computational effort, unlike other existing resampling methods in fMRI. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that the correction for temporal autocorrelation is not critical in implementing the proposed method. Results using the proposed method are compared with SPM2.},

abstract = {A variety of methods have been developed to identify brain networks with spontaneous, coherent activity in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We propose here a generic statistical framework to quantify the stability of such resting-state networks (RSNs), which was implemented with k-means clustering. The core of the method consists in bootstrapping the available datasets to replicate the clustering process a large number of times and quantify the stable features across all replications. This bootstrap analysis of stable clusters (BASC) has several benefits: (1) it can be implemented in a multi-level fashion to investigate stable RSNs at the level of individual subjects and at the level of a group; (2) it provides a principled measure of RSN stability; and (3) the maximization of the stability measure can be used as a natural criterion to select the number of RSNs. A simulation study validated the good performance of the multi-level BASC on purely synthetic data. Stable networks were also derived from a real resting-state study for 43 subjects. At the group level, seven RSNs were identified which exhibited a good agreement with the previous findings from the literature. The comparison between the individual and group-level stability maps demonstrated the capacity of BASC to establish successful correspondences between these two levels of analysis and at the same time retain some interesting subject-specific characteristics, e.g. the specific involvement of subcortical regions in the visual and fronto-parietal networks for some subjects.},

@article{Thirion2007,
abstract = {Group studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets are usually based on the computation of the mean signal across subjects at each voxel (random effects analyses), assuming that all subjects have been set in the same anatomical space (normalization). Although this approach allows for a correct specificity (rate of false detections), it is not very efficient for three reasons: i) its underlying hypotheses, perfect coregistration of the individual datasets and normality of the measured signal at the group level are frequently violated; ii) the group size is small in general, so that asymptotic approximations on the parameters distributions do not hold; iii) the large size of the images requires some conservative strategies to control the false detection rate, at the risk of increasing the number of false negatives. Given that it is still very challenging to build generative or parametric models of intersubject variability, we rely on a rule based, bottom-up approach: we present a set of procedures that detect structures of interest from each subject's data, then search for correspondences across subjects and outline the most reproducible activation regions in the group studied. This framework enables a strict control on the number of false detections. It is shown here that this analysis demonstrates increased validity and improves both the sensitivity and reliability of group analyses compared with standard methods. Moreover, it directly provides information on the spatial position correspondence or variability of the activated regions across subjects, which is difficult to obtain in standard voxel-based analyses.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists detected from different microarray studies for a same disease are often highly inconsistent. Even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, DEG detection still shows very low reproducibility. It is often believed that current small microarray studies will largely introduce false discoveries. RESULTS: Based on a statistical model, we show that even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, it is highly likely that the selected DEG lists will be very inconsistent in the presence of small measurement variations. Therefore, the apparently low reproducibility of DEG detection from current technical replicate tests does not indicate low quality of microarray technology. We also demonstrate that heterogeneous biological variations existing in real cancer data will further reduce the overall reproducibility of DEG detection. Nevertheless, in small subsamples from both simulated and real data, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) for each DEG list tends to be low, suggesting that each separately determined list may comprise mostly true DEGs. Rather than simply counting the overlaps of the discovery lists from different studies for a complex disease, novel metrics are needed for evaluating the reproducibility of discoveries characterized with correlated molecular changes.

Unlike other similar studies where number of genes in a ranked gene list is variable, this study uses an alternative approach where stability is observed at different number of samples that are used for gene selection. Three different metrics of stability, including a novel metric in bioinformatics, were used to estimate the stability of the ranked gene lists. Results of this study demonstrate that the univariate selection methods produce significantly more stable ranked gene lists than the multivariate selection methods used in this study. More specifically, thousands of samples are needed for these multivariate selection methods to achieve the same level of stability any given univariate selection method can achieve with only hundreds.},

@article{Woolrich2001,
abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or "coloring," attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening," gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x 10(-5).},

To facilitate this task, we propose a power analysis method based on random field theory (RFT) by modeling signal areas within images as non-central random field. With this framework, power can be calculated for specific areas of anticipated signals within the brain while accounting for the 3D nature of signals. This framework can also be extended to visualize local variability in sensitivity as a power map and a sample size map. We validated our non-central RFT framework based on Monte-Carlo simulations. Moreover, we applied our method to a blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set with a small sample size in order to demonstrate its use in study planning. From the simulations, we found that our method was able to estimate power quite accurately. In the fMRI data analysis, despite the small sample size, we were able to determine power and the number of subjects required to detect signals.},

abstract = {Estimation of statistical power in functional MRI (fMRI) requires knowledge of the expected percent signal change between two conditions as well as estimates of the variability in percent signal change. Variability can be divided into intra-subject variability, reflecting noise within the time series, and inter-subject variability, reflecting subject-to-subject differences in activation. The purpose of this study was to obtain estimates of percent signal change and the two sources of variability from fMRI data, and then use these parameter estimates in simulation experiments in order to generate power curves. Of interest from these simulations were conclusions concerning how many subjects are needed and how many time points within a scan are optimal in an fMRI study of cognitive function. Intra-subject variability was estimated from resting conditions, and inter-subject variability and percent signal change were estimated from verbal working memory data. Simulations derived from these parameters illustrate how percent signal change, intra- and inter-subject variability, and number of time points affect power. An empirical test experiment, using fMRI data acquired during somatosensory stimulation, showed good correspondence between the simulation-based power predictions and the power observed within somatosensory regions of interest. Our analyses suggested that for a liberal threshold of 0.05, about 12 subjects were required to achieve 80{\%} power at the single voxel level for typical activations. At more realistic thresholds, that approach those used after correcting for multiple comparisons, the number of subjects doubled to maintain this level of power.},

In this paper we formulate standard efficiency equations in terms of required BOLD effect, and use this to generate measures of rank/estimability which are meaningful. This takes into account the strength and smoothness of the timeseries noise and is applicable to complex contrasts; we show how to re-express several regressors and an associated contrast vector as a single equivalent regressor, so that we can calculate the contrast's effective peak-peak height unambiguously. We also present some example results on typical designs, and characterise noise results from a range of typical FMRI acquisitions, in order to allow experimenters to apply efficiency estimation in advance of acquiring data.},

This review discusses examples, implementation, and considerations when choosing meta-analytic techniques. It focuses on the multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) framework, which has been used in recent studies to evaluate consistency and specificity of regional activation, identify distributed functional networks from patterns of co-activation, and test hypotheses about functional cortical-subcortical pathways in healthy individuals and patients with mental disorders. Several tests of consistency and specificity are described.},

It can be used to establish consensus on the locations of functional regions, test hypotheses developed from patient and animal studies and develop new hypotheses on structure-function correspondence. It is particularly valuable in neuroimaging because most studies do not adequately correct for multiple comparisons; based on statistical thresholds used, we estimate that roughly 10-20{\%} of reported activations in published studies are false positives. In this article, we briefly summarize some of the most popular meta-analytic approaches and their limitations, and we outline a revised multilevel approach with increased validity for establishing consistency across studies. We also discuss multivariate methods by which meta-analysis can be used to develop and test hypotheses about co-activity of brain regions. Finally, we argue that meta-analyses can make a uniquely valuable contribution to predicting psychological states from patterns of brain activity, and we briefly discuss some methods for making such predictions.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies have provided strong support for a critical role of the amygdala in emotional processing. However, several controversies remain in terms of whether different factors-such as sex, valence and stimulus type-have an effect on the magnitude and lateralization of amygdala responses. To address these issues, we conducted a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of visual emotional perception that reported amygdala activation. Critically, unlike previous neuroimaging meta-analyses, we took into account the magnitude (effect size) and reliability (variance) associated with each of the activations. Our results confirm that the amygdala responds to both positive and negative stimuli, with a preference for faces depicting emotional expressions. We did not find evidence for amygdala lateralization as a function of sex or valence. Instead, our findings provide strong support for a functional dissociation between left and right amygdala in terms of temporal dynamics. Taken together, results from this meta-analysis shed new light on several of the models proposed in the literature regarding the neural basis of emotional processing.},

abstract = {Previous neuroimaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nearby brain regions in deception. This is consistent with the hypothesis that lying involves the executive control system. To date, the nature of the contribution of different aspects of executive control to deception, however, remains unclear. In the present study, we utilized an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) method of meta-analysis to quantitatively identify brain regions that are consistently more active for deceptive responses relative to truthful responses across past studies. We then contrasted the results with additional ALE maps generated for 3 different aspects of executive control: working memory, inhibitory control, and task switching. Deception-related regions in dorsolateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex were selectively associated with working memory. Additional deception regions in ventrolateral PFC, anterior insula, and anterior cingulate cortex were associated with multiple aspects of executive control. In contrast, deception-related regions in bilateral inferior parietal lobule were not associated with any of the 3 executive control constructs. Our findings support the notion that executive control processes, particularly working memory, and their associated neural substrates play an integral role in deception. This work provides a foundation for future research on the neurocognitive basis of deception.},

@article{Salimi-Khorshidi2009,
abstract = {With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research and accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a "mega-analysis", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at sigma=15 mm, KDA at rho=25-30 mm and MKDA at rho=15 mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors.},

abstract = {This work addresses the balance between temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and partial volume effects (PVE) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and investigates the impact of the choice of spatial resolution and smoothing. In fMRI, since physiological time courses are monitored, tSNR is of greater importance than image SNR. Improving SNR by an increase in voxel volume may be of negligible benefit when physiological fluctuations dominate the noise. Furthermore, at large voxel volumes, PVE are more pronounced, leading to an overall loss in performance. Artificial fMRI time series, based on high-resolution anatomical data, were used to simulate BOLD activation in a controlled manner. The performance was subsequently quantified as a measure of how well the resulted activation matched the simulated activation. The performance was highly dependent on the spatial resolution. At high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the optimal voxel volume was small, i.e. in the region of 2(3) mm(3). It was also shown that using a substantially larger voxel volume in this case could potentially negate the CNR benefits. The optimal smoothing kernel width was dependent on the CNR, being larger at poor CNR. At CNR {\textgreater}1, little or no smoothing proved advantageous. The use of artificial time series gave an opportunity to quantitatively investigate the effects of partial volume and smoothing in single subject fMRI. It was shown that a proper choice of spatial resolution and smoothing kernel width is important for fMRI performance.},

The SNR value required to observe reliable activation was determined by computer simulations. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) sensitivity maps were generated to indicate brain regions with sufficient SNR to test the statistical hypotheses. The results showed that the medial aspect of the amygdala had insufficient SNR to detect a 1{\%} peak BOLD signal change for a t-test comparison in a majority of subjects. None of these subjects showed activation in regions with unacceptable SNR values, indicating a low false positive rate. Furthermore, hemispheric asymmetries in the BOLD sensitivity maps mirrored asymmetries in the activation patterns. Impoverished SNR was also found in the basal forebrain and orbitofrontal cortex. These findings emphasize the importance of considering SNR when interpreting fMRI results in the limbic forebrain.},

The complexity of the data creates a need for statistical summary, but the local averaging standardly applied to this end may obscure the effects of greatest neuroscientific interest. In neuroimaging, for example, brain mapping analysis has focused on the discovery of activation, i.e., of extended brain regions whose average activity changes across experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a more general question of the data: Where in the brain does the activity pattern contain information about the experimental condition? To address this question, we propose scanning the imaged volume with a "searchlight," whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location in the brain.},

abstract = {When a large number of statistical tests is performed, the chance of false positive findings could increase considerably. The traditional approach is to control the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis, the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve the power of detecting treatment differences, an alternative approach is to control the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR). When some of the hypotheses are not true, the error rate from either the FWE- or the FDR-controlling procedure is usually lower than the designed level. This paper compares five methods used to estimate the number of true null hypotheses over a large number of hypotheses. The estimated number of true null hypotheses is then used to improve the power of FWE- or FDR-controlling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. The lowest slope method, developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) on the adaptive control of the FDR in multiple testing with independent statistics, and the mean of differences method appear to perform the best. These two methods control the FWE properly when the number of nontrue null hypotheses is small. A data set from a toxicogenomic microarray experiment is used for illustration.},

In fact, even nonparametric techniques such as Statistical non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM) use the mean-based t statistic to measure effect size. We note that these measures may not be particularly sensitive for detecting differences when the mean is not an accurate measure of central tendency--for example if one of the groups is experiencing a ceiling or floor effect (causing a skewed data distribution). Here we introduce a nonparametric approach for neuroimaging data analysis that is based on the rank-order of data (and is therefore less influenced by outliers than the t-test). We suggest that this approach may offer a small benefit for datasets where the assumptions of the t-test have been violated, for example datasets where data from one of the groups exhibits a skewed distribution due to floor or ceiling effects.},

Typically, the diagnostic tests are applied on simulated and pseudo-human fMRI data, and the area under the ROC curve is used as a measure of the efficiency of the diagnostic test. The effectiveness of such a method depends on how well the simulated data approximate the real data. For multivariate statistical methods, however, this technique is usually inadequate, as the spatial dependence among voxels is ignored for simulated data. In this work a modified ROC method using real fMRI data with a broader scope is proposed. This method can be applied to most fMRI postprocessing techniques, including multivariate analyses such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Also, the relationship of the modified ROC method with the conventional ROC method is discussed in detail.},

abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

This paper presents a general and novel statistical framework for robust and more complete estimation of brain functional connectivity from fMRI based on correlation analyses and hypothesis testing. In addition to the ability of examining the correlations with each individual seed as in the standard and existing methods, the proposed framework can detect functional interactions by simultaneously examining multiseed correlations via multiple correlation coefficients. Spatially structured noise in fMRI is also taken into account during the identification of functional interconnection networks through noncentral F hypothesis tests. The associated issues for the multiple testing and the effective degrees-of-freedom are considered as well. Furthermore, partial multiple correlations are introduced and formulated to measure any additional task-induced but not stimulus-locked relation over brain regions so that we can take the analysis of functional connectivity closer to the characterization of direct functional interactions of the brain. Evaluation for accuracy and advantages, and comparisons of the new approaches in the presented general framework are performed using both realistic synthetic data and in vivo fMRI data.},

Correct inference using any of these criteria depends crucially on the specification of the null distribution of the test statistics. In this article we show examples from fMRI and DTI data where the theoretical null distribution does not match well the observed distribution of the test statistics. As a solution, we introduce the use of an empirical null, a null distribution empirically estimated from the data itself, allowing for global corrections of theoretical null assumptions. The theoretical null distributions considered are normal, t, chi(2) and F, all commonly encountered in neuroimaging. The empirical null estimate is accompanied by an estimate of the proportion of non-active voxels in the data. Based on the two-class mixture model, we present the equivalence between the strategies of controlling FDR and thresholding posterior probabilities in the context of neuroimaging and show that the FDR estimates derived from the empirical null can be seen as empirical Bayes estimates.},

abstract = {A typical fMRI data analysis proceeds via the generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian noise using a model based on the experimental paradigm. This analysis ultimately results in the production of z-statistic images corresponding to the contrasts of interest. Thresholding such z-statistic images at uncorrected thresholds suitable for testing activation at a single voxel results in the problem of multiple comparisons. A number of methods which account for the problem of multiple comparisons have been proposed including Gaussian random field theory, mixture modeling and false discovery rate (FDR). The focus of this paper is on the development of a generalized version of FDR (GFDR) in an empirical Bayesian framework, specially adapted for fMRI thresholding, that is more robust to modeling violations as compared to traditional FDR. We show theoretically as well as by simulation that for real fMRI data various factors lead to a mixture of Gaussians (MOG) density for the "null" distribution. Artificial data was used to systematically study the bias of FDR and GFDR under varying intensity of modeling violations, signal to noise ratios and activation fractions for a range of q values. GFDR was able to handle modeling violations and produce good results when FDR failed. Real fMRI data was also used to confirm GFDR capabilities. Our results indicate that it is very important to account for the form and fraction of the "null" hypothesis adaptively from the data in order to obtain valid inference.},

@article{Nichols2002,
abstract = {Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation approach gives results similar to those obtained from a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible explication of the method, and no freely distributed software implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical concepts are expounded in appendices.},

abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study activation in the human brain. In most cases, data are commonly used to construct activation maps corresponding to a given paradigm. Results can be very variable, hence quantifying certainty of identified activation and inactivation over studies is important. This paper provides a model-based approach to certainty estimation from data acquired over several replicates of the same experimental paradigm. Specifically, the p-values derived from the statistical analysis of the data are explicitly modeled as a mixture of their underlying distributions; thus, unlike the methodology currently in use, there is no subjective thresholding required in the estimation process. The parameters governing the mixture model are easily obtained by the principle of maximum likelihood. Further, the estimates can also be used to optimally identify voxel-specific activation regions along with their corresponding certainty measures. The methodology is applied to a study involving a motor paradigm performed on a single subject several times over a period of two months. Simulation experiments used to calibrate performance of the method are promising. The methodology is also seen to be robust in determining areas of activation and their corresponding certainties.},

The advantages of this analysis over previous ones are both conceptual and statistical. Recognizing that the fundamental units of interest are the spatially contiguous clusters of voxels that are activated together, we set out to approximate these cluster units from the data by a clustering algorithm especially tailored for fMRI data. Testing the cluster units has a two-fold statistical advantage over testing each voxel separately: the signal to noise ratio within the unit tested is higher, and the number of hypotheses tests compared is smaller. We suggest controlling FDR on clusters, i.e., the proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected and explain the meaning of controlling this error rate. We introduce the powerful adaptive procedure to control the FDR on clusters. We apply our cluster-based analysis (CBA) to both an event-related and a block design fMRI vision experiment and demonstrate its increased power over voxel-by-voxel analysis in these examples as well as in simulations.},

Under a semi-parametric model for the data, we show that the Bayes rule can be approximated by the optimal discovery procedure (ODP), recently introduced by Storey (2007a). Improving the approximation leads us to a Bayesian discovery procedure (BDP), which exploits the multiple shrinkage in clusters implied by the assumed nonparametric model. We compare the BDP and the ODP estimates in a simple simulation study and in an assessment of differential gene expression based on microarray data from tumor samples. We extend the setting of the ODP by discussing modifications of the loss function that lead to different single thresholding statistics.

Preliminary studies suggest that noninvasive spatiotemporal maps of cerebral activity can be produced by combining the high spatial resolution (millimeters) of functional MRI (fMRI) with the high temporal resolution (milliseconds) of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Although MEG and EEG are sensitive to millisecond changes in mental activity, the ability to resolve source localization and timing is limited by the ill-posed "inverse" problem. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the use of MRI constraints in a linear estimation inverse procedure, where fMRI weighting, cortical location and orientation, and sensor noise statistics were realistically incorporated. An error metric was computed to quantify the effects of fMRI invisible ("missing") sources, "extra" fMRI sources, and cortical orientation errors. Our simulation results demonstrate that prior anatomical and functional information from MRI can be used to regularize the EEG/MEG inverse problem, giving an improved solution with high spatial and temporal resolution. An fMRI weighting of approximately 90{\%} was determined to provide the best compromise between separation of activity from correctly localized sources and minimization of error caused by missing sources. The accuracy of the estimate was relatively independent of the number and extent of the sources, allowing for incorporation of physiologically realistic multiple distributed sources. This linear estimation method provides an operator-independent approach for combining information from fMRI, MEG, and EEG and represents a significant advance over traditional dipole modeling.},

This paper attempts to review research in modern multiple hypothesis testing with particular attention to the false discovery proportion, loosely defined as the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections. We review the main ideas, stepwise and augmentation procedures; and resampling based testing. We also discuss the problem of dependence among the test statistics. Simulations make a comparison between the procedures and with Bayesian methods. We illustrate the procedures in applications in DNA microarray data analysis.

@article{Delongchamp2004,
abstract = {An objective of many functional genomics studies is to estimate treatment-induced changes in gene expression. cDNA arrays interrogate each tissue sample for the levels of mRNA for hundreds to tens of thousands of genes, and the use of this technology leads to a multitude of treatment contrasts. By-gene hypotheses tests evaluate the evidence supporting no effect, but selecting a significance level requires dealing with the multitude of comparisons. The p-values from these tests order the genes such that a p-value cutoff divides the genes into two sets. Ideally one set would contain the affected genes and the other would contain the unaffected genes. However, the set of genes selected as affected will have false positives, i.e., genes that are not affected by treatment. Likewise, the other set of genes, selected as unaffected, will contain false negatives, i.e., genes that are affected. A plot of the observed p-values (1 - p) versus their expectation under a uniform [0, 1] distribution allows one to estimate the number of true null hypotheses. With this estimate, the false positive rates and false negative rates associated with any p-value cutoff can be estimated. When computed for a range of cutoffs, these rates summarize the ability of the study to resolve effects. In our work, we are more interested in selecting most of the affected genes rather than protecting against a few false positives. An optimum cutoff, i.e., the best set given the data, depends upon the relative cost of falsely classifying a gene as affected versus the cost of falsely classifying a gene as unaffected. We select the cutoff by a decision-theoretic method analogous to methods developed for receiver operating characteristic curves. In addition, we estimate the false discovery rate and the false nondiscovery rate associated with any cutoff value. Two functional genomics studies that were designed to assess a treatment effect are used to illustrate how the methods allowed the investigators to determine a cutoff to suit their research goals.},

The distribution of these p-values is a mixture of two components corresponding to the changed genes and the unchanged ones. The focus of this article is how to estimate the proportion unchanged and the false discovery rate (FDR) and how to make inferences based on these concepts. Six published methods for estimating the proportion unchanged genes are reviewed, two alternatives are presented, and all are tested on both simulated and real data. All estimates but one make do without any parametric assumptions concerning the distributions of the p-values. Furthermore, the estimation and use of the FDR and the closely related q-value is illustrated with examples. Five published estimates of the FDR and one new are presented and tested.

While these results have revealed the potential of neuroimaging, important questions regarding the reliability of these results remain unanswered. In this paper, we take a close look at what is currently known about the reliability of fMRI findings. First, we examine the many factors that influence the quality of acquired fMRI data. We also conduct a review of the existing literature to determine if some measure of agreement has emerged regarding the reliability of fMRI.

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), plays an important role in identifying specific brain regions associated with experimental stimuli or psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. PET and fMRI produce massive data sets that contain both temporal correlations from repeated scans and complex spatial correlations. Several methods exist for handling temporal correlations, some of which rely on transforming the response data to induce either a known or an independence covariance structure. Despite the presence of spatial correlations between the volume elements (voxels) comprising a brain scan, conventional methods perform voxel-by-voxel analyses of measured brain activity. We propose a two-stage spatio-temporal model for the estimation and testing of localized activity. Our second-stage model specifies a spatial auto-regression, capturing correlations within neural processing clusters defined by a data-driven cluster analysis. We use maximum likelihood methods to estimate parameters from our spatial autoregressive model. Our model protects against type-I errors, enables the detection of both localized and regional activations (including volume of interest effects), provides information on functional connectivity in the brain, and establishes a framework to produce spatially smoothed maps of distributed brain activity for each individual. We illustrate the application of our model using PET data from a study of working memory in individuals with schizophrenia.},

This procedure is designed to deal with signal that is continuous and has, in principle, unbounded spatial support. We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FDR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control. Finally, we present an illustrative application using an fMRI study of visual attention.},

This is a problem that is unique to inference on images, in which the underlying signal is continuous (i.e., signal which does not have a compact support). In brief, inference based on conventional voxel-wise FDR procedures is not appropriate for inferences on the topological features of a statistical parametric map (SPM), such as peaks or regions of activation.

abstract = {Statistical parametric maps (SPMs) are potentially powerful ways of localizing differences in regional cerebral activity. This potential is limited by uncertainties in assessing the significance of these maps. In this report, we describe an approach that may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is made between using SPMs as images of change significance and using them to identify foci of significant change. In the first case, the SPM can be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively, the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated measures over the brain. To reject the null hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a specific location, a threshold adjustment must be made that accounts for the large number of comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend on the SPM's smoothness. Smoothness can be determined empirically and be used to calculate a threshold required to identify significant foci. The approach models the SPM as a stationary stochastic process. The theory and applications are illustrated using uniform phantom images and data from a verbal fluency activation study of four normal subjects.},

abstract = {Many studies of brain function with positron emission tomography (PET) involve the interpretation of a subtracted PET image, usually the difference between two images under baseline and stimulation conditions. The purpose of these studies is to see which areas of the brain are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima. The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields. The p value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the full widths at half-maximum of the image reconstruction process or number of resolution elements. Rather than working with local maxima, our method focuses on the Euler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold. The Euler characteristic depends only on the topology of the regions of high activation, irrespective of their shape. For large threshold values this is approximately the same as the number of isolated regions of activation above the threshold. We can thus not only determine if any activation has taken place, but we can also estimate how many isolated regions of activation are present.},
